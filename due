come to an appointment in advance, without worrying about waiting

do something before being driven by pressure.

when driven by pressure, i tend to resist the direct path, even until
missing the goal. that can be a problem, laming is better. when driven
by pressure i'm impaired. laming has strong implications in
communication. laming is a linear understandable way to increase
lateral thinking, i need to find a way to communicate it properly
though, because people link pressure with hurry. i can train hurry
when driven by pleasure.

after pressure i'm tempted to collapse back, but something tells me
it's wrong. pressure has an aura. what i like is to hang around, free
of tension. this is a second form of laming, spacing.
