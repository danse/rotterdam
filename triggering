receptive strategies ->

i don't need to do it
setting a trigger is already unlocking
and then i can be sensitive
reason, understand
and decide better
prepare, enable, make it possible
keeping something impossible
is a strong guarantee
good for disasters and paranoias
for ipersensitivity, relax
because enabling opens more doors also to understanding
