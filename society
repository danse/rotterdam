“For white communities,” López said, “I think the approach is to say
that the biggest problems in your lives are economic inequality, and
to understand that the sources of economic inequality flow from the
fact that government has been hijacked by the greedy rich and their
politicians, and that this hijacking has actually occurred because
many people have been convinced that the biggest enemy in their lives
are other poor people from different places with different faces and
with different skin color.

# radical transparency
in the evoluted european culture we are often unable to perform the
most basic movements that can make us feel better, like standing up,
stretching, talk to a stranger, sit on the ground, carry weights on
our head, get undressed.
even spending most of my life investing in transparency and expression
i still find it challenging, but expression is necessary for
communication, communication is necessary for collaboration, and lack
of collaboration leads to conflict
