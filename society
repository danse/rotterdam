“For white communities,” López said, “I think the approach is to say
that the biggest problems in your lives are economic inequality, and
to understand that the sources of economic inequality flow from the
fact that government has been hijacked by the greedy rich and their
politicians, and that this hijacking has actually occurred because
many people have been convinced that the biggest enemy in their lives
are other poor people from different places with different faces and
with different skin color.
