This file contains what we call a _figure_, but it's not parsed as a
figure by pandoc:

    $ pandoc figure.docx -t native
    ...

There seem to be multiple ways to encode a figure in an OpenXML
file. I will call them the _styled paragraph_ method and the
_cohesive_ (or _integrated_, to use an easier word) method.

### Styled paragraph

This consists in adding a paragraph after an image, with a `Caption` style. It seems to be the most used method. The image and the paragraph are different elements, thus it is possible for the user to insert content between paragraph and image breaking the relationship between the two.
