in "the failing tool", another direction is highlighted. tools communicate to us about their and our fitness. there is a culture of tools doing just what they are supposed to do, execute unidirectionally as if there was no craft or skill or knowledge implied in their successful use, and as if will didn't have to cope with reality. if we are not receptive for feedback informations about fitness, we make for a poor link in the recursion



what is possible to do, is to detect our reinforcement role and stop reinforcing facets that do not fit with our intentions, values or desires

in a way that is difficult to forecast

but the relationship is actually mutually recursive

the users can change themselves in relation to the tool, learning, know-how, skills

design and usability adjust the tool for the user hacking adjusts the tool by the user the tool can also change the user, manipulation i'd say

if it doesn't fit it's satisficing to some extent

the experience fits the tool and the tool fits the experience, intention, value
