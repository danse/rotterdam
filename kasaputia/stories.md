## una storia scritta in due lingue


kasaputia é un progetto ed una storia, scritta in due lingue.

a story is the only way to explain it all, from the start. because
it's important to show how there was nothing at the start, just an
idea and a name for it.

the idea expanded on a sheet of paper, and on a gesture: i open the
door. my kasaputia started that moment, with ridicolous ambitions.

the idea kept growing on a drawing, then on the back of the sheet
generating metaideas, peerideas and actideas.

when the front and the back were not enough, i realised it was a flow
and it wanted prose and electrons.

when i thought about the shape of the idea, i realised it had to be
shaped together, and so it was a story.

my kasaputia is my favourite way to start my day now, but maybe not my
neighbour's favourite. and maybe it's not even going to stay the same
for me, who knows? what is sure is that it will be tied to this
kasaputia. so it's a way, but also a where. the idea is not tied to a
where though.

whatever i can do good for myself, i want to give it also to my community
the community that wants to receive it

part of this kasaputia will stay here, part of it will go everywhere.

my putia is also the way i like to work, open, public, accessible and
evolutionary, a project in dialogue with all of its contexts.

this putia is offline now, which feels unconceivable for a developer
i came to this putia in order to be free to create and express
and i'm pretty impressed by how good this is working

the only light in this putia comes from the door on the street, this
leads me to be more social, even though i'm slightly paranoid about
the street, like we all are

## in vetrina

tornato a casa con l'idea di cucinarmi il pranzo, apro gli scuri
tenendo la porta chiusa. sembra strano al principio, dopo mi
abituo. mi rendo conto che é un'ottimo modo di abituarmi al
pubblico. non passa molta gente. quando passa qualche curioso, la mia
postazione mi permette di ricambiare lo sguardo, un segno di
debolezza.

## ambient tonda

today i started playing Hang Massive loud in kasa, since i received a
video from Alicia after i had the door open.

when going out i put the speaker in my backpack without turning it
off, i lowered a bit the volume and brought it with me while doing a
chore in a couple of shops nearby, nobody commented.

i went to the rotonda, the clouds were telling a story like always, i
liked how the music mixed with the landscape, i think that this is a
good place for ambient.

a few people passed by, nobody commented about the music which is now
very loud in a beautiful public space. i am writing sitting in the sun
on a bench in front of the landscape, this is my desk this morning.

i write to someone, take my time, try raising the volume and the
tempo, switch to Kollektiv Türmstrasse. I hear several songs at full
volume, really enjoying it. after one i really enjoyed i stop. the
clouds moving in the silence on the highlands are majestic.
