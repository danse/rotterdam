user interfaces built on
programming interfaces built on
data models built on
data structures.
sometimes there are no decision to make at the most fundamental
levels. At the data model level it's more common though, and less
talked about

every morning the first team member who wants writes a summary of what
happened the day before. the team member knows what happened to her,
but she just knows what the other members said they wanted to
do. reading a similar message it feels natural for the other team
members to reflect or correct

the problem with chatty interfaces is they create communities. the
problem with communities is they can decide to move elsewhere. this is
why some services prefer algorithmic sort over chatty
interfaces. algorithmic sort helps messages to spread, but is less
suited to building continuity in interactions

why i feel a gap around coding? like if there was a transition cost, a
threshold.
this gap disappears in contexts like the command prototype. there i
started from the design and organically ended up with a working
prototype
the gap disappears also in an intepreter
