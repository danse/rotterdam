thanks

an amount of hours in a time span
 stress and quality

next goal is bringing time tracking back to awareness
motivation has been the best guide
dive in dive out
trello, github issues, slack messages, github notifications, twitter
 thought dashboard, written in the shower

  danger: laboratory area

users call four months later and close to project rollout
[community call at the beginning of April](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pandoc-discuss/5W-l10MzeG8)
 do we want a sphinx reader?

every new user affects the weights
in our software we maintain networks of probabilities
that means i had some branches ready
 these days i'm pruning

and it gets defined by events
is fuzzy in the different sensitivities
 ownership
have a development value and stake
defined by user welcomes
 changing user rings

in the command line interface, the feeling of boredom doesn't last long
factoring resources
one starts spotting regularities
 the prototypes rose from shell working in repos
i was just the first proxy user
seamless development experience
 what is devops?

 i looked for users to support

engage attivare utenti
and enthusiasm is an heavily monetised resource
 in 2018 we want to change towards more enthusiasm

quotes filter to merge
the community is also being created
lack of confidence limits communication
we are not used to truly actionable sharing
i put it here in front of everyone
translating through software
 community controlled development

is it a good idea to have a wrapper?
 codesign

the way we communicate our work
besides our overall throughput
success is adoption
 what is success in this project?

 code and community

creativity peak in june, filter in italian
in the best case they would become comments, documentation
analysis notes
 seeding and pruning

 expose and codify

with haskell i could work offline
which can be disruptive
collaboration as intensification of communications
i put pandoc-to-sphinx out there and no collaboration happened
 online and batch

the pandoc manual
the main entry point's README was not in italian
different communities communicate through the source code
 globalisation and localisation

reliable and usable
portability and expressivity
  the dimensions explored moving the ship through its multidimensional space

.././/./

 a doctest

know your turtle modules
it's a case where a development direction has been deepened
 evolution of converti

user testing
proof of concept
haskell's fame for refactorings
 evolutionary prototyping

examples
cases
formats
syntax errors
sphinx features
semantic definitions
existing
 the simple dimensions
code gets stretched towards different directions over time
like a neural network
 software as an object in an high dimensional space

like a plant
like a ship
like a virus
 we can engineer software

view from the public's perspective
embarassing once i realised the publicity
surprising
 committing small patches

that's why opening the decision process is worth its cost
and its bottlenecks
we don't know the adoption we are going to support

of course it can be leaner
so some formalization is needed
but the artifacts include the possibility of being handed over
it feels odd to grow a process for a single dev

costruire sensibilità futura
mi capita poco di lavorare in un editor come docs e preferisco markdown
we are losing the skill to batch

diversità per la ricerca
conformità per la soluzione
rise fragmentation
fall simplification

che è la cosa più importante che abbiamo
cioè della nostra efficace collaborazione
sono l'ossatura della nostra comunicazione interna
ma più accessibili
con un'usabilità inferiore ad altre tecnologie
canali

and this is a context where i enjoy to work
so it has a broad scope and it can feel shallow
 it's also a story of innovation

 pandoctopus

~by the end of the project running our regression tests becomes a requirement
a small team where all are busy on multiple fronts
determined by use cases coming from users we want to attract
and the agenda is a priority function
software that's both working and broken
better than greenfield
