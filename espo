 hammer pandoc
better than greenfield
software that's both working and broken
and the agenda is a priority function
determined by use cases coming from users we want to attract
a small team where all are busy on multiple fronts
~by the end of the project running our regression tests becomes a requirement

 pandoctopus

 it's also a story of innovation
so it has a broad scope and it can feel shallow
and this is a context where i enjoy to work

canali
con un'usabilità inferiore ad altre tecnologie
ma più accessibili
sono l'ossatura della nostra comunicazione interna
cioè della nostra efficace collaborazione
che è la cosa più importante che abbiamo

fall simplification
rise fragmentation
conformità per la soluzione
diversità per la ricerca

we are losing the skill to batch
mi capita poco di lavorare in un editor come docs e preferisco markdown
costruire sensibilità futura

it feels odd to grow a process for a single dev
but the artifacts include the possibility of being handed over
so some formalization is needed
of course it can be leaner

we don't know the adoption we are going to support
and its bottlenecks
that's why opening the decision process is worth its cost

 committing small patches
surprising
embarassing once i realised the publicity
view from the public's perspective

 we can engineer software
like a virus
like a ship
like a plant

 software as an object in an high dimensional space
like a neural network
code gets stretched towards different directions over time
 the simple dimensions
existing
semantic definitions
sphinx features
syntax errors
formats
cases
examples

 evolutionary prototyping
haskell's fame for refactorings
proof of concept
user testing

 evolution of converti
it's a case where a development direction has been deepened
know your turtle modules

 a doctest

.././/./

  the dimensions explored moving the ship through its multidimensional space
portability and expressivity
reliable and usable

 globalisation and localisation
different communities communicate through the source code
the main entry point's README was not in italian
the pandoc manual

 online and batch
i put pandoc-to-sphinx out there and no collaboration happened
collaboration as intensification of communications
which can be disruptive
with haskell i could work offline

 expose and codify

 seeding and pruning
analysis notes
in the best case they would become comments, documentation
creativity peak in june, filter in italian

 code and community

 what is success in this project?
success is adoption
besides our overall throughput
the way we communicate our work

 codesign
is it a good idea to have a wrapper?

i  d
/ \
 p - b
` /
j  s

 community controlled development
translating through software
i put it here in front of everyone
we are not used to truly actionable sharing
lack of confidence limits communication
the community is also being created
quotes filter to merge

 in 2018 we want to change towards more enthusiasm
and enthusiasm is an heavily monetised resource
engage attivare utenti

 i looked for users to support

 what is devops?
seamless development experience
i was just the first proxy user
 the prototypes rose from shell working in repos
one starts spotting regularities
factoring resources
in the command line interface, the feeling of boredom doesn't last long

 changing user rings
defined by user welcomes
have a development value and stake
 ownership
is fuzzy in the different sensitivities
and it gets defined by events

 these days i'm pruning
that means i had some branches ready
in our software we maintain networks of probabilities
every new user affects the weights

 do we want a sphinx reader?
[community call at the beginning of April](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pandoc-discuss/5W-l10MzeG8)
users call four months later and close to project rollout

  danger: laboratory area

 thought dashboard, written in the shower
trello, github issues, slack messages, github notifications, twitter
dive in dive out
motivation has been the best guide
next goal is bringing time tracking back to awareness

 stress and quality
an amount of hours in a time span

thanks
