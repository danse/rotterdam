in functions one element never repeats
every subset of the cartesian product is a relation
it doesn't have to be simmetric
a relation is a subset of element pairs
functions are sets

mathematical functions are defined between sets
sets are a simple model for types
in haskell every type contains bottom returned by functions that do not terminate
a groupoid is a category where every morphism has an inverse
h . (g . f) = (h . g) . f -- i want to forget about the parenthesis
every object has a loop
g . ida = g <-> ida . f = f
for every object a there is an identity morphism
g . f -- g after f
if they are composable there will be a composition
can be infinite and have names
arrows & morphisms
they described the world in terms of special relationships
composition & identity define category theory
category theory in some sense could be closer to episthemology than onthology
abstract thought is very fresh and primitive in comparison with other evolved skills
functional languages as paths to the more abstract category language
surface & interface
