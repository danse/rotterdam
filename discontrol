to some ground, which is chaotic
or the cursor, or the focus, or the attention
when one is able to move the tip
deeper rooting starts

work as an activity grounded on (regulated by) money making
or productivity
can be seen as paths to a desirable root

then detect when they get lost
work for the conditions to be there
for example productivity and comfort
one can select specific conditions desired in the setting
a root is easier to analise than a process

i sit comfortably on my uncomfortable root
my unpleasant root is giving me a lot of gems once i made it enjoyable

a root taints anything that leads there

the root is the place where ideas hit us and become ours
when they hit us they create a branch that has our name on it
that keeps branching, giving us options
there is some ego in every branch
the root has to be very personal for me
in order to conceive ideas that seem worth pursuing
i can be very selective about technology that's part of one of my roots

come una linea che attraversa una sfera
l'esplorazione di uno spazio che ha più dimensioni di quelle tracciate
and could eventually be redefined
metrics are like doors for goals to be achieved
trying to go beyond metrics while using them.

whichever frame is unsuited to an everchanging source
drifting from a root rather than aiming
growing complexity as a feature of successful diving

load through a memory pass
over control
some reactions give us a ton of matter out of nothing
a root tip suited to the ground
a mark on moving matter

circuits provide control: empty spaces, polished surfaces, threads,
routines. Even when delicate and flexible. A root can be a checkpoint
in a routine. Queues circle threads for shortest time, stacks for
longest time


un'idea sulla radice si può continuare a sviluppare o vivere di più

a conversation can be seen as a shared root

it's the system of recursive amplification
which leads to directionality of chaotic systems over time
which makes stacks so powerful

 primitives
bubble
push pop scan remove edit save swapstack
clear is just on some stacks
append on most
clear-append is awkward in emacs
separate archive
autoremove or sort
free, when you detach
the unit is visually a paragraph here, not sure about a name

almost anything supports stack algorithms

pop in versus pop out frequencies

items get popped mostly from the top or the bottom
reordering is possible but expensive

stack growing algorithms


a bookmark like a pointer to a filesystem path

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)
In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object, whose
value refers to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the
computer memory using its memory address. A pointer references a
location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is
known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a
book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page;
dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page
with the given page number and reading the text found on the indexed
page

the tip of the ground for input
the tip of the roots is for output

the tip is the exposed part

lift is to move back to the empty part of a tip and center


the anonymicity of items in a stack is the optimal condition at the
moment of storing but the worse at the moment of accessing,
retrieving. that's why many stacks benefit from processing strategies
and that's why it makes sense to have some abstract concepts of the
tip of a stack and the heterarchy of priorities. it's an heterarchy
without a common root. it features multiple paths and multiple
roots. but the structure gives us paths and a program and an abstract
structure to look at as organisation and communicate, clarify, be part
of the heterarchical system

# receptive strategies
ways to affect the uncontrolled
## slow down the fastest visible metric
evening
wandering
laming
spacing
padding
## bubbling
in absence of drives
quietly make your environment rounder
and more comfortable
## rooting (centering)
leverages our ability to detect changes
for when we want some conditions to be met
inclusivity, comfort, priorities
defining the root helps us to detect when conditions are violated
and it helps us to come back to a setting where they are met
## triggering
a confusing way to make triggering is stopping just before a goal

thought is still predated
in different ways
but our society accepts most of them
like in advertisement
and we know some of them
with tools that became more sophisticated over time
by agents of social control
it's also an activity that's been always predated
it's in general not an easy activity in itself
