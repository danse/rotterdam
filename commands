it feels more and more natural to me to have shallow Bash wrappers
around Haskell commands

.

for me the most comfortable way to develop small Haskell commands is
to have a single repo building all of them, with a generic repo
name. they can eventually be extracted. that repo could be added to
the path and it would be easy to put also small Bash commands there
