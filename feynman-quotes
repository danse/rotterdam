For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations,
for Nature cannot be fooled.
- Richard P. Feynman

I was born not knowing and have had only a little time
to change that here and there.
- Richard P. Feynman

Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns,
so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the
organization of the entire tapestry.
- Richard P. Feynman

It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is,
it doesn't matter how smart you are.
If it doesn't agree with experiment,
it's wrong.
- Richard P. Feynman

If I could explain it to the average person,
I wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize.
- Richard P. Feynman

Reality must take precedence over public relations,
for nature cannot be fooled.
- Richard P. Feynman

Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars -
mere globs of gas atoms.
I, too, can see the stars on a desert night,
and feel them.
But do I see less or more?
- Richard P. Feynman

I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific
problems is just as dumb as the next guy.
- Richard P. Feynman

It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission
of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous
motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined,
permanently blocked, as it has so many times before
in various periods in the history of man.
- Richard P. Feynman

The idea is to try to give all the information to help
others to judge the value of your contribution;
not just the information that leads to judgment in
one particular direction or another.
- Richard P. Feynman

We are at the very beginning of time for the human race.
It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems.
But there are tens of thousands of years in the future.
Our responsibility is to do what we can,
learn what we can, improve the solutions,
and pass them on.
- Richard P. Feynman

There is a computer disease that anybody who works
with computers knows about.
It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work.
The trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them!
- Richard P. Feynman

Scientific views end in awe and mystery,
lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to
be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it
is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man's struggle
for good and evil seems inadequate.
- Richard P. Feynman
