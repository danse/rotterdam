sorry folks, but a few years ago...  i mean have you ever heard of hippies here in ragusa?  or what did you make of them?  there weren't concentration camps for foreigners at the time, there wasn't this surge of fascism.  they were your friends, right?  they tended to stick to welcoming people.  i guess they had something to teach, maybe they had a clue about one thing or two, which could sound interesting

now i don't see much sign of their teachings around.  mc donald's has been assimilated better than the sexual revolution, and SUVs are more popular than feminism.  people go to clubs just to show their outfits, the only dancers are the immigrants you exclude.  so dunno ... which place did you reserve to those outsiders?  maybe they looked obscene, so you hid them into some closet.  you marginalised the change like now you do with kids and immigrants, trapped even in the word that distinguishes them among the foreigners.  or maybe you marginalised them behind the word "tourists", your cash cows

maybe you pidgeonholed them as communists, deluded believers in what you consider a failed faith.  that's maybe why the city i came from does not welcome me back, because i don't own a car, because i don't wear a suit, because i don't buy expensive interiors, because i ignore television and netflix

on the squares of this city, expression is trapped in a sad and dry hymn to consumerism, in a conformism surrended to paranoias.  here is the temple of materialism and productivity, grey and boring, or empty.  cheerfulness did not win on this square, the fascist eagle won.  a fake eagle of course, too rigid to be authentic, nested on the churches and in the stadiums which are so familiar to it.

alright tell me the non-address of their batcave where i can dance with them and enjoy technologies of fun.  there must be a place around where people have fun together, right?  the few artists i've met are brave and beautiful, but i still feel a bit lonely and a bit lost

yet we won in some sense...  africa, india and arabia share our poverty.  we are all more spiritual and less catholic, and the monsters of capitalism hide in their expensive caves paying an high bill every month in order to forget what is freedom

look at our common spaces, they are all empty for us, warm and sunny!  we could take a free day, put some music on and dance in our balconies, in our streets, alone or with strangers, ignoring the sex, forgetting our obsessions just for a short while.  without pictures on facebook and without capitalising contacts.

so folks, where did you hide them? i've been here a week i'm looking forward to relax a bit!
