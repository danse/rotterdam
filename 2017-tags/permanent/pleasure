Cracks of light outside the system
Orderly introduce chaos
The new order is pleasure
Feminine is pleasure
She understands diversity and respects it
She loves it in them
She is not violent
She knows why limits exist
She seeks unity, yet is strong alone
She is strong of her weakness
She knows how to make us all strong, through our weaknesses
She is ancient
She has suffered a lot
She has learned a lot
She is everywhere
She has time for us
She needs you
