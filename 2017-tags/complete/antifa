It's odd to see how the Spanish culture can be deeply anti-american,
while embracing the messages of violence and dominion that spread out
of most of American mainstream media production, including
videogames. The same applies for the culture of right-wing movements
through all Europe and the world. It's also sad to experience how
Americans, that once freed us from fascism, crafted the cultural tools
that now empower fascism globally. From the point of view of
technology, this crafting is still in progress
