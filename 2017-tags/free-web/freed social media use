##### location

first of all, i use firefox. it has a decent location bar, where by
decent i meant that it does what it should.

with the firefox location bar i can type few letters of the name of a
friend or community, and enter directly into their profile.

this fixes manipulation, because i'm driven directly by my thoughts,
and i access directly to the friend's contents sorted as they want to
sort them.

this fixes lock-in, because when a friend or community will decide to
switch to their own website, it will be easy for me to type their
site's name on the location bar and brows to their content.

this way social media like facebook or twitter just serve as a testing
and growing ground for future publishers

##### notifications

i disable all algorithmical notifications and most group
notifications, so that i get notifications only from real persons
engaging with me. this way i can have conversations rather than be
targeted by marketers.

twitter recently moved to a system where i cannot disable
algorithmical notifications, and since then i stopped using twitter.

##### asynchronicity

i keep notifications unread so that i can postpone answering
indefinitely. this frees me from the compulsive habit of answering
immediately, and enables me to keep the quality of the conversations
high. when i have time, i go through them from the oldest to the
newest.

##### name

in an anti-logo effort, i write the names of companies or products
like twitter, facebook and others lowercase. if they managed to enter
our daily language as common terms, at least they have to pay this
price for it
