winning in culture


if we consider culture like a good that can be duplicated, having
adoption as its mean of survival

then the culturally winning features of an identity end up freeing
themselves and becoming unidentifiable features

the path to losing the feature's identity is part of the feature's
identity, as such it is diverse, but it needs to end into
communicability, and communicability is very powerful and dangerous

maybe this is why we can sometimes spot dare or ambition in winning
cultures

being negative about the diffusion of an identifying feature defines
its limit
