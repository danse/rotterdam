merge requests to this branch adding:

- a command and required functions following the documentation. Note
  that the command will replace `cycle-drop`

- a property test that `dislike . like = id` for non empty lists

cycle-like --dis


takes the last entry, collects existing entries in the list, adds one
entry and adds them back to the list evenly spaced. The resulting list
still has the same last entry.

>>> like [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 7]
[1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6, 7]

reverse of `like`, drops single entries

>>> dislike [1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6, 7]
[1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 7]

>>> dislike [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2]
