```
we found ourselves in the wrong place
at the wrong time
and loneliness is a cradle
and the endless night welcomes its rhythm
our eyes wouldn't close, while our soul found a roof
clearly we didn't count the hours
because our dark cover is now leaving us exposed

when a slow conflict fires the sky
it bleeds and it's beautiful
slowly light flows everywhere
birds sing, fishes populate the sea
everything is so quiet now, it's already day
and the sun is still not there

maybe we don't care about it after all
our sky is all ready for a new boring day
when some clouds start looking funny
strokes of light catch our eye on them
then they blur, then they expand
we tought the sky was bright, but it keeps changing
the light we didn't expect keeps glowing
it starts feeling glorious, and the sun is still not there

now we don't really need it
this is enough, this is plenty, this is everything we wanted
somehow we found ourselves at the other end of society
at the other end of our wandering
exhausted and surprised, we realise this day is ours
the sun is there
```

#### Meaning

i wrote this experiencing a dawn in ragusa in june 2017. later i reworked the notes to describe some experiences i did in the last years. the sun represents a fetish, while light represents our well-being. through feeling comfortable and leting our comfortable habits expand out of our private life (the night) and out of closeting into a public space (the day) we reach our goals without even paying attention to them, and when the fetish arrives we tend to forget all the changes in the context which led to it. a friend used to tell that "the night is the darkest before the sun rises", but my experience tells the opposite. i always suffered when aiming at goals that wouldn't come, and they finally arrived when i was not aiming at them any longer, but i had fixed everything else around them without grit
