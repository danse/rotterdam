today i started playing Hang Massive loud in kasa, since i received a
video from Alicia after i had the door open.

when going out i put the speaker in my backpack without turning it
off, i lowered a bit the volume and brought it with me while doing a
chore in a couple of shops nearby, nobody commented.

i went to the rotonda, the clouds were telling a story like always, i
liked how the music mixed with the landscape, i think that this is a
good place for ambient.

a few people passed by, nobody commented about the music which is now
very loud in a beautiful public space. i am writing sitting in the sun
on a bench in front of the landscape, this is my desk this morning.
