nomodas digitales

flying from the bar at your corner's seat
rather than flying from an airplane seat

bubbling out will be super smooth
if i can confortably nomad out the day

so i live it day by day
without a personal sacrifice
but i don't a plan to make it real for me
i seem to believe deeply in nomadism for europe

madrid could be the european capital where i found more spirituality













se il viaggiare mi entusiasma più che gli altri pensieri
per lo meno ho un pensiero che mi entusiasma

travel because social media polarize and fragment our society

nomadism gives me back the human side
of my passion for global communication
we don't want to connect only through tech
but through culture, customs
developing empathy
and personal dedication

a strategy for solo nomadism is trading lifestyle
or local culture
or more that i can't describe
that can be an alternating engine
for more relational stability

alternatively it can enable to change perspective
on the same remote object

many singles start their day from a virtual society even without nomading

quando sono obbligato a fare il lavaggio del cervello con musica commerciale in un altro paese, per lo meno non mi rendo conto che é la stessa roba noiosa di 20 anni fa

at home we can be ourselves but lacking the comfort of society
in a work day
tension between cultural comfort and material comfort

and one can see through many threads
places where inconsistencies are more visible
node places, frunteer places, places where the circuits are open
