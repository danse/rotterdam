Kim Albrecht’s talk will show how glitches reveal the inner workings of the systems we trust everyday and how visualisations can help us in our algorithm-driven society.

Kim Albrecht visualizes cultural, technological, and scientific forms of knowledge. His diagrams are meant to unfold and question the structures of representation and explore the aesthetic of the intermingling of technology and society through the sensual knowledge of tracing information.

Peter Crnokrak’s talk will focus on the historical dynamics of war and conflict and its effect on human creative output by surveying the last 500 years of scientific discoveries and artistic creations.

Peter Crnokrak is a computational artist whose work addresses the ever changing reference point of reality and experience, with a particular focus on the extremes of societal behaviour as a means by which to characterise the human condition. His practice is an experimental platform that utilises symbolic logic to communicate meaning in complex systems with work integrating research, analysis and experimental technologies.
