the space of the eye is the space of control, that we want to keep empty 

the eye space is also a good place to be offtrack and to take off from

in the control space one cannot be centered unless it's empty

i suspect that the opposite of the control space is not a space, it's
somethin like an activity, a process, a flow

i like most of my spaces to tend to empty, but as a feature within a
goal like anchoring or expressing. the goal of the eye control space
is just to be empty

i have a problem with conveying creative energy towards a desired
direction. the concept of thread or closed circle came to mind. the
eye control space is a primitive closed circle

the empty eye control space is by design uninteresting, thus it frees
the mind and the eye. it naturally fits the role of a rest space, as
such it is central
