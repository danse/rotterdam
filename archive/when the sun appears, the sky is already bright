we found ourselves in the wrong place
at the wrong time
and loneliness is a cradle
and the endless night welcomes its rhythm
our eyes wouldn't close, while our soul found a roof
clearly we didn't count the hours
because our dark cover is now leaving us exposed

when a slow conflict fires the sky
it bleeds and it's beautiful
slowly light flows everywhere
birds sing, fishes populate the sea
everything is so quiet now, it's already day
and the sun is still not there

maybe we don't care about it after all
our sky is all ready for a new boring day
when some clouds start looking funny
strokes of light catch our eye on them
then they blur, then they expand
we tought the sky was bright, but it keeps changing
the light we didn't expect keeps glowing
it starts feeling glorious, and the sun is still not there

now we don't really need it
this is enough, this is plenty, this is everything we wanted
somehow we found ourselves at the other end of society
at the other end of our wandering
exhausted and surprised, we realise this day is ours
the sun is there
