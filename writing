people engineer industries around jargon, acronyms and buzzwords, but the code of language works differently ... and the commercial use of language makes us all poorer by preventing us to use the code for our personal and communitary growth. an expert writer (or talker) can use jargon when desired while using the full power of the code for personal and interpersonal understanding

le passioni si spostano sul letto... tipo scrivere
scrivo per passione e per niente altro
una passione a volte creativa
a volte fisica e carnale
che si nutre del pubblico come di una trasgressione
molto volubile ed intensa
che a volte nel suo violento spaziare
si scontra attraverso la pagina
proiettandosi
bucandola
e lasciando dei segni

first is passion, then it's writing

lowercase because that's what letters were designed for

i like writing upwards for elevating the thought but it started because of a limitation: on emacs i couldn't do empty writing without going bottom to top. then it merged with the natural intuition of a stack and the research about new priority

also writing has different dimensions of success
there is being authentic,
enjoy what you are doing
being comfortable and free
or making money
or living in a cool place
or feeling happy while doing it
or change something
or help someone, even when that doesn't change the world
and won't make you big on social media
and no, that won't give you money today
but maybe it'll make you a better person
and these are my dimensions of success
big like my hearth
and humble like my wallet
broken like my passion for music
and free like you can be only in virtuality
only in our minds, in our dreams,
in our free fall
