 Woke up, feeling overtired
Been working day 'n' night
Of coped to let it out
Shaked my body to the ground, down to the ground
Music keeps calling me
Throughout the galaxy
And escape on frequency
'Cause I'm a slave until I sleep

And waiting for this moment to hit are we?
I'm waiting for this moment to hear you speak
Now that I can feel you here
I have nothing left to fear

And waiting for this moment to hit are we?
I'm waiting for this moment to hear you speak
Now that I can feel you here
I have nothing left to fear

Still not feel overtired
Slow motion in my mind
Of coped to let it out
Shaked my body to the ground, down to the ground
Evolution in my veins
Been everywhere anyway
Still off, feel lonely
Until I'm here with you again

I've been waiting, for this moment
Too head are we
It's been so long, I have missed you
Take me higher

'Cause I believe in elevation

And waiting for this moment to hit are we?
I'm waiting for this moment to hear you speak
Now that I can feel you here
I have nothing left to fear

And waiting for this moment to hit are we?
I'm waiting for this moment to hear you speak
Now that I can feel you here
I have nothing left to fear
(Fear...)
