Some Sunday morning see you
Picking up the fun
Ticking down the last time
Before the credits run
The traffic is'nt moving or it's moving awful slow
To the sound of you complaining
We got nowhere left to go
You need the drugs to make the stars come down
You need the drugs to make you shine
You need the pills to take you home again
Don t be so ladida, so ladida
You need the drugs
You need the drugs to make the stars come down
You need the drugs to make you shine

Don t be so ladida, so ladida
You need the drugs
All of your tomorrows are a dream I never had
Everything is broken, everything unsaid
But I see all your shadows running
Circles at my feet
And you re making all the promises that
No one never keeps
You need the drugs to make the stars come down
You need the drugs to make you shine
You need the pills to take you home again
Don t be so ladida, so ladida
