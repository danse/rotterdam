The Hinterhaus

There is a house behind your house
a floor beneath the floorboards
with planks of spruce sanded smooth
and cut to fit the corners
and no one would have noticed
no one could have guessed
that every time they’d come around
they’d been your courtyard guests

when was it that you forgot?
who you were and were not
how to feel as you looked out
at all man’s suffering and pain,
so exquisite, so mundane
saw the trigger of a gun
curled like a question mark

I know what it is
to be half transformed
still burdened with the evidence
of what you were before
but all of this forgetting –
tell me how it’s done
tell me where you keep the memory
of somebody you’ve loved

there is a house behind this house
curtains upon curtains
oh but you can come anytime you like
my door is always open
