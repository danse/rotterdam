# what is recursion? 127

nesting and variations on nesting

a recursive definition always defines something
in terms of a simpler version of itself

one of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life
is when you postpone completing a task
in favor of a simpler task
often of the same type

# pushing, popping and stacks 128

and resume operations where left off one level deeper
close operations on one level
to pop is the reverse

and to take up a new task
without forgetting where you are
to push means to suspend operations on the task you're currently working on

one of the first languages for artificial intelligence
introduced in the late 50's as part of IPL
push, pop and push-down stack
basic terminology of recursion in computer science:

# stacks in music 129

we maintain a mental stack of keys
and each new modulation pushes a new key into the stack
we want to hear the sequence of keys retracted in reverse order
until the tonic is reached
this is an exaggeration 

any reasonably musical person automatically maintains a shallow stack
with two keys, the tonic and the pseudotonic

a local resolution should heighten the global tension rather than relieving it
because it is a piece of irony
tension and resolution are the hearth and soul of music

# bottoming out and heterarchies 133

indirect recursion

there can be a whole family of networks which are all tangled up
calling each other and themselves

a program which has such a structure
in which there is no single "highest level" or "monitor"
is called a heterarchy

term due to warren mcculloch

# recursion and unpredictability 152

for a set to be recursively enumerable
means that it can be generated from a set of starting elements
by repeated application of rules of inference

thus the set grows
each new element being compounded out of previous elements

this is the essence of recursion
defining in terms of simpler versions
instead of explicitly

recursive enumeration is a process in which
new things emerge from old things by rules

it might seem that
some types of recursively defined sequences
exhibit increasing complexity of behavior
so that the further you go the less predictable they get

# language as an activator 628

(original title "the structure of shrdlu by winograd", 628)

all language use can be though of as
a way of activating procedures within the hearer

we can think of any utterance as a program
one that indirectly causes a set of operations to be carried out
within the hearer's cognitive system

this program writing is indirect in the sense that
we are dealing with an intellingent interpreter
who may take a set of actions which are quite different
from those the speaker intended

# creativity and randomness 673

creativity is the essence of what is not mechanical
yet every creative act is mechanical

when programs cease to be transparent to their creators
the approach to creativity has begun

the world is a giant heap of randomness
we can mirror some of it inside our heads
