tension and resolution are the hearth and soul of music
because it is a piece of irony
a local resolution should heighten the global tension rather than relieving it

with two keys, the tonic and the pseudotonic
any reasonably musical person automatically maintains a shallow stack

this is an exaggeration 
until the tonic is reached
we want to hear the sequence of keys retracted in reverse order
and each new modulation pushes a new key into the stack
we maintain a mental stack of keys
