so that the further you go the less predictable they get
exhibit increasing complexity of behavior
some types of recursively defined sequences
it might seem that

new things emerge from old things by rules
recursive enumeration is a process in which

instead of explicitly
defining in terms of simpler versions
this is the essence of recursion

each new element being compounded out of previous elements
thus the set grows

by repeated application of rules of inference
means that it can be generated from a set of starting elements
for a set to be recursively enumerable

recursion and unpredictability 152

term due to warren mcculloch

is called a heterarchy
in which there is no single "highest level" or "monitor"
a program which has such a structure

calling each other and themselves like crazy
there can be a whole family of networks which are all tangled up

indirect recursion

bottoming out and heterarchies 133

often of the same type
in favor of a simpler task
is when you postpone completing a task
one of the most common ways in which recursion appears in daily life

in terms of a simpler version of itself
a recursive definition always defines something

nesting and variations on nesting

what is recursion? 127

we can mirror some of it inside our heads
the world is a giant heap of randomness

the approach to creativity has begun
when programs cease to be transparent to their creators

yet every creative act is mechanical
creativity is the essence of what is not mechanical
