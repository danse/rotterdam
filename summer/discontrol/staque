the anonymicity of items in a stack is the optimal condition at the
moment of storing but the worse at the moment of accessing,
retrieving. that's why many stacks benefit from processing strategies
and that's why it makes sense to have some abstract concepts of the
tip of a stack and the heterarchy of priorities. it's an heterarchy
without a common root. it features multiple paths and multiple
roots. but the structure gives us paths and a program and an abstract
structure to look at as organisation and communicate, clarify, be part
of the heterarchical system

a stack should automatically move edited plants to the top
