managing sensitivity
allows us to let it develop

sober sad comfortable space on a sunny sunday morning at home naroma alx

starting from the mind
from control
trying to project its will on the world
lifting from the tail 

pure reaction

this attitude gives me freedom to follow instinct and be open to interferences
identity opens itself to react to events
symptom coherence, where feeling is a different form of understanding
this way identity extends to all domains that are received

imperfection and openness
expression rather than control
mixing channels
events can be endogenic or esogenic
planning and opting is just another way to react to imagination

since this involves feeling it seems romantic which is confusing

enables handling a project with a flexible scope

how valuable is control?
