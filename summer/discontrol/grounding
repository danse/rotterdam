they reduce accessibility to a single tip thus focus
or if there are several
but only one currently accessible
there can be many tips in different namespaces

where mental stress is not required
rooting is my focusing
many tips but one focus

so a tip is more exclusive and valuable
a name can encompass way more than a limited visual or phisical space
 or choosing contents to call the tip
 my choosing contents for the top
one can expose, focus
in a stack without top, there can be a tip

and rising with its leaves
browsing a growing forest

more freely
where leaves can grow
a bit closer to us
there is ground and there is air

to some ground, which is chaotic
or the cursor, or the focus, or the attention
when one is able to move the tip
deeper rooting starts
here the vegetal metaphore becomes messy
rooting can start moving the tip from trunk to trunk
the tip is not related to any trunk
and anti-informatics
so it's an anti-hierarchy
the tip is the source of the flow
and a trunk
there is a tip
stacks make trees or fractals because they develop recursively

my ground is also my highest sky
through respectful happy nodes
while i open that capacity

work as an activity grounded on (regulated by) money making
or productivity
can be seen as paths to a desirable root

a root is set externally but a center is felt internally

i sit comfortably on my uncomfortable root

then detect when they get lost
work for the conditions to be there
for example productivity and comfort
one can select specific conditions desired in the setting
a root is easier to analise than a process

my unpleasant root is giving me a lot of gems once i made it enjoyable

a root taints anything that leads there
the more sensitive the more far away the tainting from the actionable root
consistent symptoms require more work to be understood

the root is the place where ideas hit us and become ours
when they hit us they create a branch that has our name on it
a branch in time and space, at least
that keeps branching, giving us options
that's what makes us feel free
there is some egocentrism in every branch
the root has to be very personal for me
in order to conceive ideas that seem worth pursuing
i can be very selective about technology that's part of one of my roots
even to the point of intentionally reducing technology as much as possible
even to zero
think about living with zero technology

so the more time i use to produce
the less time i can use enjoying my root
there are many reasons for wanting to produce
change something
my ego
threats
expectations

and pleasure itself. but for the path i choose, pleasure moves the
root rather than branching out of it

a way to select a task to do is to start another task without stress. that way i spontaneously start thinking about things i care more

in the past my roots were less enjoyable
a root is simply the place were you are at a time
mental, social, physical, emotional place
it can be analysed

its features and how they change. was it your will? why did that happen?
the root, the present moment, is the source of everything we can
