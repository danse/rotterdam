i couldn't think the way i liked
because i couldn't enjoy thinking because
i wouldn't feel allowed
to spend time thinking
now i realise
i actually always enjoyed it a lot
but i often had to look for it elsewhere
and i've probably always wanted to do more of it
or do it right or the way i like it
and i imagine other people are in the same situation
because it's not so easy for us to think
it's easier to be brainwashed
it's probably never been that easy to think
it's in generela not an easy activity in itself
it's also an activity that's been always predated
by agents of social control
with tools that became more sophisticated over time
and we know some of them
like in advertisement
but our society accepts most of them
in different ways
thought is still predated
