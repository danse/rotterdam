un'idea sulla pila si può continuare a sviluppare o vivere di più

every stack is a trunk

detach from a stack and go back to root before the ground dries up too much

elements on a stack can refer to the ground
kind of creating a new ground upon which one can root

i have no hurry to formalise such algorithms
algorithms on stacks aim to minimize the impact of these limitations
we work on tops of stacks due to limitations in our process

stacks have many tops and one bottom, ground
which can generate always new stacks
a root is there to transform the ground
growing stacks

grounding, packing

partially ordered by dependency
stacks primitives and algorithms form a set
i wanto comfort not to be too unevenly distributed on the set

space, search, dive in, jump out

a conversation can be seen as a shared stack

it's the system of recursive amplification
which leads to directionality of chaotic systems over time
which makes stacks so powerful

 primitives
bubble
push pop scan remove edit save swapstack
clear is just on some stacks
append on most
clear-append is awkward in emacs
separate archive
autoremove or sort
free, when you detach
the unit is visually a paragraph here, not sure about a name

almost anything supports stack algorithms

how many brilliant people you know that keep stacks of magazines around?

pop ins are more frequent than pop outs
items get popped mostly from the top or the bottom
reordering is possible but expensive

stack growing algorithms
