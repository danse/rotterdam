a bookmark focus would be like a token

and closer to the user goal
but focus is more intuitive

as it is the handler for a filesystem path
in this sense the file should be called pointer

in the area where file paths are stored
or one might say, by moving the address' path before the address name

but by selecting one address

and the pointer is actually moving not by moving the address

in this case the same address word gets unicity by its path

In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object, whose
value refers to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the
computer memory using its memory address. A pointer references a
location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is
known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a
book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page;
dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page
with the given page number and reading the text found on the indexed
page

a cursor plugs on a?


ground tip stack tip sky

the tip of the ground for input
the tip of the stack is for output

the tip is the exposed part

lift is to move back to the empty part of a tip and center
