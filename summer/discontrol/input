the one line margin allows me to turn thought time into visual rhythm

giving some contents (symbols?) a chance to affect more or less of them
that is pass through some of the circuits

through a memory pass
load

over control











a variable volume pen changing more or less slowly
some reactions give us a ton of matter out of nothing

a root like an hook

a root for action

a root tip suited to the ground

a mark on moving matter

ground tip sky
