l'esplorazione di uno spazio che ha più dimensioni di quelle tracciate
come una linea che attraversa una sfera
a tre e sessanta
and could eventually be redefined
metrics are like doors for the sourcing to happen
which tries to go beyond metrics while using them
is just my perspective on work on productivity

to share the cost of shared growth
since it's passing barriers it goes naturally with volunteering




una radice sposta una sorgente sposta e si sposta
diving raises from the pursue of quality in free work

e la crescita porta al superamento
diving è investire perché investire porta crescita

dentro e fuori la tecnologia
mentre investiamo
il senso di responsabilità può guidarci

because i'm drifting from yet another source
this is now yet a different drift

not even structured nor that static
code is good as a source but many sources are not formalised
whichever frame is unsuited to an everchanging source

from that point on it's a channel towards the unknown
a root can provide a foundation

definitely habits hardly keep up with everchanging needs
ed in effetti scardina abitudini abbastanza consolidate

drifting from a source is preferable than aiming

growing complexity as a feature of successful diving

within closed spaces
drawing internal rainbows
the source gets always finer
