up for a tunnel i anchor by entering the desired spaces

making such spaces if they don't exist. i let my energy flow freely on a theme

no fear to dive towards the shortest path in order not to be dragged away

feeling plentiful i would enjoy playing music, so i anchor myself to work

it's a deeper type of development

when it gets universal i bring the work to universal with me
