Another vote for Torino. Plenty to do around town. Beautiful ambiance that is authentically Italian that hasn’t been overrun by tourists. A coworking office near Via Vanchiglia with an amazing community (spazio19). San Salvario area is your best bet if you’re looking for a hip area that is open late with things to do
