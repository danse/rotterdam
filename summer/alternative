i've always looked for alternative culture. i've always disregarded what everybody desired. we all admired and wanted it, no discussion, but i never aimed for it.

the more i grew, the more i tried to free myself from the hamster wheel. it's about the definition of success. both at school like at work or in life, you can either buy into an existing definition of success or simply look for your own.

now more and more i feel the need to move a step further
i don't want the alternative label to be a new fetish
i don't like to struggle to avoid the desirable goals
i want my fresh look on them, my own perspective on them, my own personal relationship with them.

and maybe this relationship can be like the one of many other persons, and that is probably going to bore me rather fast,
or maybe i will stop seeing fetishes and start finding meanings
