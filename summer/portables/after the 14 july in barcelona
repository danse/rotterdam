our fears
we put them there
we thought they would help us
and now they are our prison
break it

we just don't have time to waste on the answers

i cannot tell you that everybody lies to you

travelling
studying
dancing
 things i learned to love

everything can dance

then the other two came in
one was smaller than us, and didn't move
but it talked a lot, all the times
it talked for hours without stopping
sometimes quietly, sometimes very loud
i'm not sure that the others where listening to him
