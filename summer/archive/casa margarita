where is the space for a programmer here? it looks like there
isn't. the software is monolithic and doesn't leave room for accessing
the logic.

the system is full of unused options and interfaces, i bet it would be
more reassuring without them

opening parenthesis, closing parenthesis, also here, every day

even paper-based info is outdated

communications via booking feel clunky

booking tries to extend to the domains of the software, while the
software tries to integrate with booking's data

the software is full of usability issues but i see no room for
fixing. the software is proprietary and seems like freeware.

communications with other services seems raw but functional, it has
error feedback

some alerts added automatically, removed manually
objects are messages and tasks

people tend to reduce control screens to one or a few. the same page
of the software is always open, with the same panels expanded or
collapsed.

powerful online and organic tools
many levels of automation, connectivity and informatics
quality takes more time and pleasure, not cutting
