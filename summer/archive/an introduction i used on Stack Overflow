Hello, i am a full-stack developer, experienced in Javascript and Python and passionate about Haskell and functional programming. I am already working for a client on a part-time basis and i am looking for a new client to fill the other half of my working week.

This is my Github account, where you can find samples of my work:
https://github.com/danse. One interesting example is this service built with Node and Bacon https://github.com/eHealthAfrica/sense-dispatch, or this Angular app with 100% test coverage https://github.com/danse/citizendesk-frontend

I am keeping this short because i am not sure that you might be interested in somebody with part-time availability, but please feel free to get in touch in case of any question.

Cheers,
Francesco
