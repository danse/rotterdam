Now that i'm not a believer, perfection is not a problem for me any
more. I can pursue perfection without being deluded, without expecting
it to be absolute. I don't have to remind myself that "perfection
doesn't exist", because it exists and i can reach one, and then reach
a different one, over and over and over and over. It feels great :)
