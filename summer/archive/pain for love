pain for love is the most powerful drug i ever tried

it leads me to weird, dirty, unknown places

outside of my comfort, outside of myself

it gives me a violence that i'm afraid of

and i need all my strength to turn the violence into energy

it breaks the boundaries, the rules, my own identity

it cracks me open

it leads me outside of my understanding, to a place where to be nobody, then a new me

it feels dangerous and scary

it's all i've got

let's throw it on a floor

let's give it a rhythm, and a crowd

let's dance it out

it will turn us into better humans
