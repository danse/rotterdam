who does the system belong to?

the mind relates them giving them a language, a system

body and desire open and close windows, relating to each other

between goal and tools

between position and destination, present and future, dream and history

this is why i feel creative at the point of contact between the goal
and the means

it doesn't feel like creativity otherwise

its ways its terms its toolset

creativity needs to mold its tools

creativity tends to overflow its channels

weirdness

some experience of success

a safe method for experimentation which produces something valuable

the experience of possibility

it doesn't need material resources, but the freedom to be allowed to

exposes the inner workings, the principles the science, the facts, the
knowledge, the craft, the art

this way creativity breaks cultural chains of control
