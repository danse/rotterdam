since when i was a kid at school, people around me have been fighting
against me being distracted

come to an appointment in advance, without worrying about waiting

do something before being driven by pressure.

when driven by pressure, i tend to resist the direct path, even until
missing the goal. that can be a problem, laming is better. when driven
by pressure i'm impaired. laming has strong implications in
communication. laming is a linear understandable way to increase
lateral thinking, i need to find a way to communicate it properly
though, because people link pressure with hurry. i can train hurry
when driven by pleasure.

after pressure i'm tempted to collapse back, but something tells me
it's wrong. pressure has an aura. what i like is to hang around, free
of tension. this is a second form of laming, spacing.

and then the pressure resolves itself, and there is no goal any
more. this can confuse us at times, but it's actually what i'm looking
for. After this solution i can come back to a creative state

reduce pressure is making space, too, but often in order to do that,
we need to put ourselves on the path of greatest pressure
