## about prototyping

one of the difficult parts is that the adequate prototyping of
non-functional features is delegated to the builders' expertise, and
its accuracy can be assessed only late. this also applies to usability
and marketability. it's not granted that the results achieved during
prototyping will be portable to the production phase

writing down the assumptions can help to verify them later and to
share them with the rest of the team

### classification based on the quality of the foundation

##### throwaway prototyping

bad quality

the commitment to throw it away enables to follow dangerous paths,
without the risk of them ever leaking to production

##### proof of concept

no assumption on the quality

the idea is to keep what can be kept and change the rest, the proof of
concept should be analysed eventually in order to decide what to do
with it, which changes are needed, etcetera

##### incremental prototyping

high quality

minimalism
