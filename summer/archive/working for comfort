my life as a programmer in europe was too comfortable. i felt that working in order to make it more comfortable would become exclusive and reduce the freedom of movement of my ideas and myself. that applied to habits like free time, work friendships and the use of technology. as a nomad, my life can be very uncomfortable. i feel fine with working in the direction of making it more comfortable, because i hope that it will open the path to more nomads. so i feel more free to buy technology and work on what before i had avoided
