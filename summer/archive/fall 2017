since when i started nomading my approach to work changed more and more

after nowhere i was in the position to challenge my most fundamental habits

travelling through peripherical places in the middle of summer, also
my technologies and logistics were challenged to a point where i could
collect only a small amount of productive hours

in these conditions, i started working for two clients simultaneously
for two projects that were rather challenging in very different ways

i refused to be stressed, but couldn't avoid being somehow stressed

i reacted and recovered, and i learned that my productivity is
currently below my own expectations

i consider my contribution to one of those projects successful, and my
contribution to the other project unsuccessful

i feel like there is an open thread related to unsuccessful
contribution, that i have to close before moving on
