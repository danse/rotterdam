the depressing effect
even without ideological comfort one can feel

it feels like danger to my quality of life

even one who actively tried to control it
it has way more impact on a nomad

living without it for a while feels difficult

not this way
i had changed and wanted to free myself from the device
el ciclo de la cuempra se hub√¨a parado

it's a rather emotional moment, jessy's voices
