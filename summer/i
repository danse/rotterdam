learning and love have always been connected to me

care a lot about avoiding lock-in


I am a strange programmer. Sometimes i'll fail to get excited about
the new technology, but i like to speak many different languages,
including English.

Whenever i spot a silo, i look for a way out. I am extremely
interested into interdisciplinary problems.

I write lowercase "i", because i like it more that way. I am not an
impostor though, i feel at home in the freaky world wide web.

I like to spend my time on software that will last, and will help a
lot of users. I can build a throwaway prototype if you want, but then
i'll make sure that we will throw it away. Low budget? I can build an
evolutionary prototype if you want, let's chat about that.
