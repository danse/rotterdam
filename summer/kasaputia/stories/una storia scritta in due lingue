kasaputia Ã© un progetto ed una storia, scritta in due lingue.

a story is the only way to explain it all, from the start. because
it's important to show how there was nothing at the start, just an
idea and a name for it.

the idea expanded on a sheet of paper, and on a gesture: i open the
door. my kasaputia started that moment, with ridicolous ambitions.

the idea kept growing on a drawing, then on the back of the sheet
generating metaideas, peerideas and actideas.

when the front and the back were not enough, i realised it was a flow
and it wanted prose and electrons.

when i thought about the shape of the idea, i realised it had to be
shaped together, and so it was a story.

my kasaputia is my favourite way to start my day now, but maybe not my
neighbour's favourite. and maybe it's not even going to stay the same
for me, who knows? what is sure is that it will be tied to this
kasaputia. so it's a way, but also a where. the idea is not tied to a
where though.

whatever i can do good for myself, i want to give it also to my community
the community that wants to receive it

part of this kasaputia will stay here, part of it will go everywhere.

my putia is also the way i like to work, open, public, accessible and
evolutionary, a project in dialogue with all of its contexts.

this putia is offline now, which feels unconceivable for a developer
i came to this putia in order to be free to create and express
and i'm pretty impressed by how good this is working

the only light in this putia comes from the door on the street, this
leads me to be more social, even though i'm slightly paranoid about
the street, like we all are
