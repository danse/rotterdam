Norbert Wiener,
:::
:::

::: {.full-article-text-wrapper}
<div>

<div>

Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) was a fascinating figure. He is probably best
known for his 1948 book Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the
Animal and the Machine which founded the discipline of
cybernetics. Cybernetics combined information theory, biology, computing
and many other discipline to study the command and control of systems.
Besides that he was a pioneer of early computing and automation, and was
active in social activism, later in life for example resisting military
use of scientific research.

</div>

<div>

 

</div>

<div>

Recently I came across a
[letter](https://libcom.org/history/father-cybernetics-norbert-wieners-letter-uaw-president-walter-reuther)
he had written in 1949 to Walter Reuther, a legendary leader of the U.S.
trade union movement. Wiener had worked on automating anti-aircraft guns
during the second world war, and through his studies saw that automation
was about to hit manufacturing and thus union jobs. Wiener wrote the
letter after a company contacted him for a consulting job about
automating human labour, in the letter he writes that:

</div>

> <div>
>
> \"I would give a guess that a critical situation is bound to arise
> under any condition in some ten to twenty years; but that if war
> should make the replacement of labor mobilized into the services an
> immediate necessity, we should probably have a concentrated effort put
> into this work which might well lead to **large scale industrial
> unemployment** within two years.
>
> </div>
>
> <div>

>

> </div>
>
> <div>
>
> I do not wish personally to be responsible for any such state of
> affairs. I have, therefore, turned down unconditionally the request of
> the industrial company which has tried to consult me \[he had been
> asked by a corporation to help automate jobs\]. **However, it is
> manifestly not enough to take a negative attitude on this**. If I do
> not put this information in the hands of the industrialists, it is
> merely a question of time when so obvious a method of procedure will
> be urged upon them by other people.\"
>
> </div>

<div>

Thus he offered Walter Reuther a recommendation:

</div>

> <div>
>
> \"What I am proposing is this. First, that you show a sufficient
> interest in the very pressing menace of the large-scale replacement of
> labor by machine on the level not of energy, but of judgment, to be
> willing to formulate a policy towards this problem. **In particular, I
> do not think it would be at all foolish for you to steal a march upon
> the existing industrial corporations in this matter; and while taking
> a part in production of such machines to secure the profits in them to
> an organization dedicated to the benefit of labor.** It may be on the
> other hand, that you think the complete suppresion (sic) of these
> ideas is in order. In either case, I am willing to back you loyally,
> and without any demand or request for personal returns in what I
> consider will be a matter of public policy. I wish to warn you,
> however, that my own passiveness in this matter will not, on the face
> of it, produce a passiveness in other people who may come by the same
> ideas, and that these ideas are very much in the air.\"
>
> </div>

<div>

No response has been documented by Reuther, and most likely the union
leader ignored the eccentric academic. Since then, however, automation
has been used to break union strongholds, the degree of automation of
something like
[dockwork](https://libcom.org/library/effects-automation-lives-longshoremen)
being the perfect example of this.

</div>

</div>

And although evidence has come out that automation has not been the only
cause for loss of employment in traditional union bastions, outsourcing
or a \"spatial fix\" in the words of [Beverly J.
Silver](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/forces-of-labor/24F7A6E01DA0617159FCCC7A6F68FC40),
also contributed greatly (maybe more than mainstream economists want to
[admit](https://qz.com/1269172/the-epic-mistake-about-manufacturing-thats-cost-americans-millions-of-jobs/)).
Nevertheless automation has had a negative effect on union strength
throughout the western world.

Today we are probably at the edge of a new wave of automation, driven by
new technologies such as AI. And even though I think effects have been
mischaracterised (read my [recent
piece](https://newsocialist.org.uk/is-automation-really-such-a-threat/)
in New Socialist about it!), this new wave can most certainly be
targeted towards remaining union strongholds and ascending sectors of
workers who are organising.

So what are we to do? \"Stealing a march\" on existing capitalism might
not be a bad idea. Not necessarily by organising a robot tax, as Wiener
seems to suggest, but by **steering the direction of automation for
ourselves**.

In the last newsletter I interviewed [Adrian
Smith](https://tinyletter.com/FullyAutomated/letters/tech-the-left-interview-1-adrian-smith)
of Sussex University about automation, here\'s a quote that particularly
inspired me:

> *\"So, it seems strange to me just how much automation policy focuses
> on the 'impact' technology will have on jobs and society, **as if
> particular technological futures were an unavoidable force of
> nature**. That way of looking at technology suits the interests of
> incumbent developers, and unduly privileges the trajectories of
> development that they want to make happen. If you look carefully at
> groups working in *open hardware* networks and makerspaces for
> example, you'll see **they are subverting, adapting and appropriating
> many of the technological ingredients of 'automation' - computation,
> sensors, actuators, computer numerically controlled machine tools,
> design software, microelectronics, internet platforms, 3D
> scanners/printers, video, etc**. But the technologies are being taken
> in directions and used for purposes quite different to industrial
> automation. They're working along technological trajectories inspired
> by social visions quite different to the 'cyber-physical systems' of
> Industry 4.0 advocates. Instead, activists are pursuing ideas for
> commons-based peer-production, knowledge as commons, free culture,
> solidarity economy and commitments to social values like sustainable
> development.\"*

Automation is not simply a process that is apolitical and rolls over us
like a wave, rather it\'s human driven process that reflects the biases
of the developers and designers that make the systems. **And more
importantly, it\'s driven by the preferences of the capitalist
businesses and investors bringing this technology to market**.

**So why shouldn\'t the union movement, impacted as it is by automation,
do the same with it\'s still significant capital reserves?** Why does,
for example, Airbus
[fund](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/faculty/engineering/news/airbus-raeng-chair-1.776488)
academic chairs in the digitisation of manufacturing, but don\'t trade
unions fund similar research into human-oriented uses of automated
technology? Why don\'t trade unions work with hackerspaces to design and
test devices that could improve the working lives of their members? Why
don\'t they steer the target of technological research away from profit
and towards human gain?

Of course this might easier said than done. Developing the capacities to
steer technological research and development are hard, and certainly
cannot be taken for granted. If we, however, want to take control over
the direction technology takes, changes need to take place in who funds
its development and what priorities are made. Trade unions, inherently
rooted in our workplaces, occupy a great space to do this.
