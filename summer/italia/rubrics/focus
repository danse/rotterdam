alberto produces tables of contents with sphinx

do rubrics appear in the table of contents?

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/doctree.html#rubric

replace RST rubrics with strong text?
- rubrics are less readable than strong text markup?
- indentation is harder to edit?

this is rendered as a rubric because it's not at top level

rubrics were added here
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/2079

here we have rubrics outside 
rubrics.native
