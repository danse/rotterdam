consider a spanning structure like the following, where i added row numbers in order to refer to them easily:

```
   a b c
   - - -
1  d e f
2  g _ i
3  l m _
```

here row 2 is connected to row 1 through cell `e` while it is connected to row 2 through cell `i`, so our parser will have to produce:

```
Sep def [Sep withBorder [Cell 'a', Cell 'b', Cell 'c'],
         Sep def [Sep def [Cell 'd', Cell 'g', Cell 'l'],
                  Sep def [Sep doubleWidth [Cell 'e'], Cell 'm'],
                  Sep def [Cell 'f', Sep doubleWidth [Cell 'i']]]
```

basically an intermediate separator causes a change in direction
