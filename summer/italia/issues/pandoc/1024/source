candidate data models

the last proposal from jgm is rather essential
by proposing a pull request with these core changes i can help unlocking
but there can be a set of core changes enabling the community to help
this feature seems rather far because it requires a lot of changes

it also has comments in general about the data model but it seems ignored
first comment on dependent types, the second is the proposal by mb21

a more precise estimation can be very useful for planning

we can generate random well-formed tables built in this data model
we have no guarantee that the parsed table is well-formed
