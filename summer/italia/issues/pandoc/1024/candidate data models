i was thinking about a way to experiment with data models before rolling out the adoption process, and i had an idea which enables us to successfully convert cell spans from DOCX to RST in italia/cell-spans.

the idea is to go through a transition phase where cell spans are encoded as attributes in a Div wrapping cell contents. while in the transition phase, readers and writers can be developed using two transformations:

    tableToCandidate :: TableCandidate -> Block
    candidateToTable :: Block -> Maybe TableCandidate

this approach enables translating spans from day zero without the burden of a data model that will be difficult to change later. different candidate data models can coexist until we will choose a winning one and deprecate the others.

the cost of updating data model candidates is proportional to adoption, therefore it will be easy to update the less popular candidates.

we can consider the candidates not only in abstract through the data model, but also in practice through the functions that operate with them, we can test them.
