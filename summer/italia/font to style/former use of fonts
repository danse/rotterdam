i think that this is used just for math in some elements

symbol font improvements
https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/1518
the functions in texmath seem to support only a Symbol Font
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/texmath-0.10.1.1/docs/Text-TeXMath-Unicode-Fonts.html

in Docx.Parse the font seems to be used only for decoding
while in Odt.StyleReader the font pitch is used as we want to use the face

Docx.Parse and Odt.StyleReader work with fonts
