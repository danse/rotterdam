(

that finer tests are a good investment at the moment
given that the interface is not great i'm not sure anymore

type NameSpaces = [(String, String)]
 
elemToRun :: NameSpaces -> Element -> D Run

via finer tests
while new contributors can easier be introduced to interesting parts
the authors probably have a deeper knowledge of the dynamics
except for Jesse Rosenthal (jkr) and John McFarlane
this file didn't see much contribution
but finer tests can help also newcomers in the future
tests aren't that fine-grained at the moment

 namespaces passed everywhere
 WrongElem
 isElement used multiple times and within element-specific functions
refactoring

there are many maybes in the code
