my neighbour is an old man and he listens to a main Spanish radio
channel the whole day. i can't hear the words, but i'm constantly
upset by the tone. the tone is always alarming, always loud, always
authoritative, calling for attention, telling about some emergency,
pressing. there is never a pause, a moment to relax, a moment of quiet
enjoyment. how can he submit himself to this continuous stress? does
it help him? does it bring him anything good? my neighbour is an old
man, and he has old habits
