creativity produces (branches leaves)
update amplification grows the trees

lisp can be seen as a one-file tree
to simplify navigation

the most convenient way for me to express written text
is connected to lisp

not because i use emacs
because i use emacs as simply as i could use gedit

i branch out also in life in order to feel more comfortable
i close technological parenthesis, tooling parenthesis, working parenthesis
in order to feel better, unless an annoyance
brings be back closer to the have to specturm

i branch out and i come back
with memories, with feelings
with inspirations.

so i need to take track. publicly. without exibitionism. in a
technologically and economically sustainable (accessible to anybody)
way

yeah, somebody has problems with money
in order to get to technologies like windows,
mac, a good android.

they are always a step behind
so i am also a step behind with emacs

is comfort at work smaller than branching out
if i'm a free man
i am using only the most comfortable technology
i'm not a masochist





























in emacs, visually a center expands,
at some point it becomes two centers
and i go from one to the other of them
just in order to keep them updated
oh, and weed
and the rest of a ritual
which brings me closer to the day
to the silence,
to all of us
the ritual makes creativity grow
to express what is in us
and what can be in us

(the name is the ritual)

i'd like this to be a tree though
in emacs, my back buffer is reseted when i go back and forth
so i can't go deep
without forgetting where i came from
and zooming out
this makes me go back to the stack
and start from the topmost level
oh no the topmost is awful
it's a todo list!
shit
my travel ends here

refactoring can keep me engaged a bit more
i can use history list to see my back history with interleaves
and pick a level or an interleave
now, social
offline first
and decoded
