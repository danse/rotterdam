for example

- consistency, partitioning, availability
- consensus
- game theory
- probability
- crypto
- real time scheduling
- deep learning
- genetics

but with my mathematics, very simple

i don't learn much by proofs
because they are hard like data

when i go through one though i realise that understanding proofs gives insights

it conveys a deeper understanding than just by using or remembering the result

one cannot help but believing it or working towards its falsification

often proofs also involve story telling

the radical prototyping approach would be to start from proofs i
analyse for myself, for example with literate code
