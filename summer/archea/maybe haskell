Hi all,

With reference to the recent articles about the Haskell pyramid, i
thought to reach out to beginner Haskellers in order to work together
on some project.

Maybe it's easier when beginners work together on beginners projects,
it can be an effective way to work together. Sometimes when we look at
projects written by experienced Haskellers, we find an even higher
entry barrier.

There are mainly two project that might meet some interest:

- A library for providing a strictly typed interface around D3
  visualisations, this can be currently used to launch visualisations from the command line
- A command line client for filtering and sorting jobs on Upwork
  ... <sarcasm> in order to be absolutely certain that there in nothing worthy
  up there </sarcasm>

Now, the state of the code there is awful, but both projects work for
me.
