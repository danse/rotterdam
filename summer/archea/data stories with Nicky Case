stories about systems
from existing systems to simulations
complex -> simple
through the power of play
learning is not passive
it is acting on the thing you want to learn
.
explorable explanations are closer to journalism than serious games
.
plot twist
.
make something intuitive -> you can also change someone's intuition
feedback loops, bottom-up systems
before i was able to build interactive stuff for myself
playing you can be faster and deeper
you can also communicate faster and deeper with a game
.
there are already a lot of models, math and analysis about many systems
.
sandbox mode
.
better ballot was inspired by a visualisation
.
system visualisation
.

even reading is actively reconstructing what is read. rebuild using
our available experiences and understandings. a conversation is an
exploration. a dialogue is better than a monologue. game design is
applied psychology

.
expectations failure
.
act like a tour guide. linear with areas for exploration
text cannot be explored
interactive is unguided
it's a story about a system
a part of the system is presented at a time
the user understands the parts and relationships between them
sandbox at the end
start in the middle, work towards the parts, then work towards the sandbox

domain specific tools, embeddable explanations
accessible <-> domain specific
the less specific is programming
.
simulations
pick a scientific simulation
boil it down to its gist
.
  explorables
 data
 phisolophy: socratic dialogue explorable explorations
 news: decisions of a Syrian refugee
