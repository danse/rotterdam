I don't invest time in digging for hidden feedback. I let it express
there where others want. I might ask for it, but not investigate about
it.

Sometimes i can get a feel or a clue about something negative building
up. Sometimes i think about the worst, and that makes me naturally
move in the direction of prevention.

If i work well, the negative feedback will manifest itself gradually.
In the interest of everybody involved, we will have a chance to
communicate our identities and our ways.

Some prefer not to communicate, not to negotiate. They prefer to have
the upper hand and take their decisions autonomously. This
unidirectionality naturally leans a relationship towards its end.
