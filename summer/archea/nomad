As a nomad, i can develop technology without the risks i experienced before.

Technology is now a tool for me for breaking barriers that prevent
people from getting together and understanding each other. This is
what i am doing every day, this is how my whole life is oriented.

I don't risk to use technology to defend privilege, capital, racism,
bigotry, isolationism or other conservative values, because this is
not how i am. Now i proved it even to myself, with facts, with my
effort, with sacrifices, with what i gave away and with what i am
looking for.

I am nomading on Linux thanks to the efforts i did _before_
nomadism. That was my way to defend myself from all the bad attitudes
in the industry. When that turned up not to be enough i resorted to
nomadism, but the result is that some of my old trenches are not of
use any more.
