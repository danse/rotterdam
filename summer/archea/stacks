it might be a good idea to reintroduce the red notebook. that should
be the entry point for new tasks. it's harder for me to think deep in
front of a screen, and often i have a problems with connectivity or
power or i don't have the laptop with me. having a paper-based entry
point for new tasks can fix all of this.

a stack data structure prioritises recent items, so that the writer is
always empowered to the maximum. this is the kind of attitude i want
the system to enable, so as a rule last items have the highest
priority.

this also enables to write with full power on different instances.

this also means that not following the list is respecting priorities.

when creating a new stack, it's useful to do so by keeping some
reference to the previous stack, even just in the name. this way they
can be followed back respecting the priorities
