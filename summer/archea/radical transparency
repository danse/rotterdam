in the evoluted european culture we are often unable to perform the
most basic movements that can make us feel better, like standing up,
stretching, talk to a stranger, sit on the ground, carry weights on
our head, get undressed

even spending most of my life investing in transparency and expression
i still find it challenging, but expression is necessary for
communication, communication is necessary for collaboration, and lack
of collaboration leads to conflict
