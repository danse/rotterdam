Walking through Lavapi√®s it's clear that We Europeans don't need
airplanes to travel. The world came to us. We have India in our
cities, and the provinces of China. We have The States, part of
Russia, some lucky ones have a lot of Abya Yala. Africa is our
neighbour and often knocks an our door to chat.

We don't need tourism to learn about the world, we need better doors
through the walls of fortress Europe. Doors connecting different
codes, different gods, different ideas of love, different kinds of
violence.

Sometimes we feel so bored, when we are surrounded by people that look
all the same. We know that we need each other, but we didn't
understood it yet. We don't need airplanes, we need to drop our stupid
fears.






"different kinds of violence" is not included because of its
meaning. It's included because of the intensity of the image it
evokes. That intensity is supposed to engage the reader and make their
mind spin at a deeper, more thoughtful angle.
