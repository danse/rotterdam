love is also made of trust. There are different ways to cumulate trust
about someone. One way is by collecting data, another way is by
understanding. Collecting data is also a way to understand, according
to everyone's culture. Can one mix up the data point with the entity
which is being measured?

If i trust somebody without understanding them, just because of their
achievements, maybe my trust is deluded.
