title: constantly behind
---

Blockchain, web, artificial intelligence. Using Haskell means being
consistently behind others when tackling a new technological
challenge. It means not being able to use existing libraries and
tutorials, not facing the same problems as those most people face, not
being able to fit in existing communities.

Why do i do it, then?

Well, for once, because i like Haskell, and i feel that it helps
me. I've grown to believe in the power and usefulness of individual
intuition and research.

The existing can be seen as a barrier to change, and i think that a
developer is a person that can always find a way for change and
improvement, even in situation that seem locked, blocked, frozen.

Where will this bring me? Maybe nowhere, maybe somewhere. It's this
journey the most important thing i can share with others, not my code
or my products.

Also, i like development, but i don't like the tyranny of the bleeding
edge. I care about my right not to be chasing that, it's a right to
diversity and freedom. So ... to be constantly behind, free to chase
my own wave, free from the anxiety of leadership, from the anxiety of
the crowd. Maybe this is is a benefit i'm already reaping.

And of course, i don't want to stop communicating with the rest of the
world. I'll keep looking for bridges and way to connect
