title: i cannot leave Berlin, but i am already a nomad
style: clear

Anger is leaving room to reflection, frustration is leaving room to
creativity. I am being held here by a system that i despise, but while
i feel extraneous to that system i realise that i am already behaving
as a nomad. I have to. The system is taking my material resources, i
won't allow it to take also my mental ones. I am starting to create
again, i am finding my spaces again, i am outside from this all,
whatever happens.

As a nomad i feel weaker and stronger at the same time, i feel just
different, just like being elsewhere. The stark experience of the
non-physicality of this difference is fascinating. I'm still here, but
already elsewhere. Understanding this makes me feel free, and better.
