title: quality control
---

one of the reasons i became a freelancer was to improve my
professionality. Most of my efforts in the last year have been about
expanding my pool of clients, but things did not go as expected. I
ended up being rather static with my client, thus i need to update my
metrics. I started a research meta issue about quality control. In
practice this will probably turn into a conversation with my client,
but i would like it to be assisted by data.

One of the metrics that interest me is the time per week, what is the
client's perception about it. Do they think that it's too much, too
little?

I am afraid that weekly time sharing might affect productivity. I need
to verify this with my means and by asking the client's feedback.
