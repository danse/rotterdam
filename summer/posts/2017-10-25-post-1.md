while i start expanding and freeing my routine, i still feel the
constraints of the routines that until yesterday were enforced

.

the stress of August is like a crack in my story, a place where an
object impacted on my system. some broken parts extend until now, the
others are just memories that reveal me something new

.

culture, society and expectations lead to rigidities even when one is
remote or nomading. i always knew it, but maybe not so clearly. i
wanted to challenge it and i did it

.

i was able to force things through my pain

.

i cannot freely stop that movement, now it has its own momentum, i
have to let it end

.

moving alone in the dark i finally broke

my old corporate glasses made of steel and advanced technology. i used
to like them, besides the logo that was too visible. they were
discrete but with personality, robust, flexible, convenient, a bit
magic, they tried to pretend they weren't there

it's time to get some new ones

less expensive, less shiny, less metallic, more visible and common,
maybe more fragile, suited to an healthier life and inspired by a
friend
