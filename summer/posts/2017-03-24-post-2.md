title: twice in a day
---

I had some success this morning adapting Opwer and running R commands
to get some insights on the jobs. Now i can try to use the new
knowledge actually using the tools and searching for work.

As far as i remember, this is the first time i write a second blog
post within the same day. I find this useful, but it's different from
traditional blogging. I should probably rearrange the site so that
micro posts and normal posts are presented differently
