title: si paullum a summo discessit, vergit ad imum

*"If [she, he or it] misses the top of a little, [she, he or it] leans
[or tends] to the bottom"*

It's from Horace's *Ars Poetica*, but used in Hofstadter's book in a
clever way that i want to remember. Sometimes missing the goal even a
bit leads to a total loss
