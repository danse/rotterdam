title: looking for work
---

Wow, looking for work can be depressing. It shouldn't be like
that. This makes me whish i wouldn't have to look for work. I guess
that this is what happens to all of us: when we find work we like, we
don't want to go back to that state of uncertainty. This makes sense,
but being motivated by fear is not what i want.

I guess that i should enjoy the uncertainty and leave the enjoyment
guide myself towards new work. Anxiety can prevent me from spending
too much time into activities that won't lead me anywhere.

Too much anxiety is paralising though, and this is a bit how i feel
now. I would like to bring back more enjoyment into job search, but
i'm not sure how. Anyway, even just having that as a method can guide
me through the alternatives, it's helpful.
