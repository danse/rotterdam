title: the first readers?
style: clear
----

after some years of existance, today this blog had its first readers,
or at least i hope so, as two frriends asked me about it and i sent
them the link.

this marks a watershed for this blog that i had abandoned. if i really
had some readers they were the first ones, but how to know that it
really happened?

my preferred way to know is to receive some feedback from them, but is
this blog receptive to feedback?

this blog's only support for feedback is providing contact
details. this is not welcoming to readers. i can add a disqus panel in
order to make it easier for readers to comment. i added the task to my
stack.

anyway, they already gave me feedback with their interest, and the
result is that i'm updating this blog, thus interrupting the process
of abandonment.
