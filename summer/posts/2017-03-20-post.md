title: trying again with liquid work
---

Despite i had little results, i'm going to try to invest a bit more on
liquid work, which also means investing more in Upwork, mainly.

The directions are two: on one side, a bit of code to get some metrics
out of my data, like my average rate per worked hour and my average
worked hours. Then i could use that data with the Hyperbolic rating
algorithm.

The other direction is analysing data coming from Upwork job offers,
categorising by the amount of hours required per week ... and possibly
the due date.

I would like to invest two or three weeks into this, it should be
enough to get something usable
