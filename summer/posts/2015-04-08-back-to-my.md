### Back to my Island

For such a long time i have been thinking about this freedom the
Internet gives us, it was part of my beliefs, of my motivations. *I
like the Internet because it allows people far away to do big things,
to express themselves*.

So i finally did it, i came back, and it is not going to be easy.

I started from an ideal job, with great colleagues, and now i face the
problems coming from my decision
