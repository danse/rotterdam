title: upwork is for liquid work
---

I just used the new filters in my job query on Upwork. The results
were more interesting than usual. The idea of "liquid work" was the
reason why i bothered using Upwork in the first place, but over the
months i somehow forgot it, i forgot how it linked to the Hyperbolic
schema and the whole concept i had in mind.

It came back to my mind recently thinking about how bars price their
products, but now, after years since when i had the first intuition, i
collected some tools, software and experience that is helping me to
turn the idea to reality.

Selecting only the jobs that fit in this schema reduces a lot the jobs
i get, but this is not a bad thing. Full time, traditional jobs are
not what Upwork is interesting for.

It's bad anyway to be locked in to the platform. In fact rediscovering
the Hyperbolic system enables me to start collaborations also outside
Upwork, but it's nice how Hyperbolic and Opwer seem to work well
together
