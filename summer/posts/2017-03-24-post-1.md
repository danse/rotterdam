title: today's plan
---

Here is an overview about the main coding projects i'd like to work on now:

- liquid work
- haskell bot
- map of Europe
- offline apps
- tooling
- start storytelling on ecotracks

I'm stretched rather thin. There are also several technologies i would
like to learn, but for the moment i'm studying the Hofstadter's book
and the Purescript book. There are also some collaborations i might
start:

- blockchain with Sandra
- bots for health with Cristina
- an online store with Javier
- Haskell web apps with Vacation labs

All of this should be done in my time free of clients' work. As i
wrote, i'm stretched rather thin, but i don't feel like cutting
branches for now. I could archive branches, that's true.

I'll focus today's coding session to liquid work, as it progressed
rather fast until now, and i see the chance to wrap it up successfully
in a short iteration
