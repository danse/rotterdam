title: a bit of discipline
---

This week i experimented a bit more discipline in the way i manage my
time. I was experiencing fatigue and lack of motivation, but most of
all i was not confident any more about my productivity.

In the last year i left myself free to switch context at any
time. During a typical working week i would switch often between my
client's time tracker and my personal time tracker, in order to be
able to follow up on communications, ideas, study, and other input or
inspiration i could get during a day, that was not related to my
client's work.

This week, i had the intuition to be more conservative and try to log
the whole day on a single tracker. This prevents me from following up
on some communications, and forces me to write down ideas to check
better later, but it has the advantage of keeping me engaged with the
client's work.

With the former approach, staying engaged was a challenge. As a result
i had a more fragmented day, with more stress and less
productivity. This week i could keep more continuity on my client's
work, so i collected more hours this week than in every week for the
past two months, which corresponds more or less to the beginning of my
nomadic life.

For me the number of hours is just the tip of the iceberg. The real
goal is to do more meaningful work, and to understand better what i am
doing.

I might change this discipline in the future, but for the moment i
want to register an immediate success with the new habits!
