I started quite a lonely journey in the past weeks, looking for a job
with Haskell. I looked at all resources offered by the community, at
the main employment sites, i stalked some companies which were
supposed to use Haskell internally, i completed my profile on sites
for remote work and i applied to some jobs which had no constraints
about the technology to be used.

Now i seem arrived at a dead end, it seems to me that there is no
other place left to try or to look into. In a perfect world, i would
have no reason to feel stuck, because my interests would lead me to
like-minded people. So if i am interested in Haskell, i could just
start using it to fix problems, and find travel companions along the
way.

I think that i will actually try this. I just need to withstand the
pressure of being without a job, out of the stream, on my own.
