the state of unsatisfaction i feel while starting to work on a ticket
in my current project is excessive.

The project is going to finally end soon, but i come to think that i
paid too much for this, probably i did a mistake at some point.

I thought that the time i spent studying could balance for any
frustration. I thought that i could enjoy working on this project,
maybe i was thinking that my cumulating unsatisfaction was
unjustified. Maybe i have to rethink those assumptions. Some others
proved right, and yielded some results for me, my colleagues, my
client.

Money had a role. In a context where i couldn't easily find new
satisfying work opportunities, it felt suicidal to abandon a
consolidated and fair collaboration, whose goals i shared.

The error in this attitude can be related to insecurity, and using
money as an indicator for value. If i want to develop further my
professionality, i need to understand better value beyond money. I can
practice this principle immediately, looking for new clients on the
base of value and not money.

I did this in the past and it led to an enriching but not fully
positive experience. Now i feel like i learned a lessons or two, and i
can give it another shot. In the last years i positioned myself the
best i could, in order to keep investing in value rather than money
