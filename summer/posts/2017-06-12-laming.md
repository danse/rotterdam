i have this style of hacking ... not Googling. So for example if i
want to style an hr, i don't look for "style an hr", but i want to
understand the boundaries of my craft: which attributes are available?
How to get to that list? My reference doc -> the standard
specification.

This can also mean browsing a table of contents rather than following
full-text searches. I feel like this approach feels extremely old
fashioned, in a trend where smaller screens lead us to abandon
overviews and context.
