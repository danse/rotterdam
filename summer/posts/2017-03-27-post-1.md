title: Mur, European visualisation and team work
---

A new week is starting, i've got little time today and a lot to do. A
project that desperately need more love is the Mur project. I kind
of left it half way.

The thing is that i want to write Haskell. That inspires me right now,
and makes me feel like i am moving forward. I write in web
technologies for the most part of my work, and that makes me tired.

I'm a bit sorry for Mur, but it feels like i can't pool more
motivation about it at the moment. The initial idea was to have it
ready before the French elections, but:

- i had less time after leaving Berlin. I devoted time to other
  projects like the Blockchain research group and tooling for liquid work
- i lost some hope in my capability of shipping anything that could
  help for the elections, in time
- the problems i encountered were more tedious than expected

Looking at this as a whole, i think that this could have gone better
if i was working in a small team. Working in a team keeps me engaged
and enables me to go further in terms of results. Also, using web
technologies makes sense, for me, just because it's easier to share
them. But working on them by myself i don't perceive the advantage.

I'm not sure how to start a small team via the web, but at least now i
have a reason more why to do it

No, i don't think that Mur can be ready for the elections. It's still
a project i care about, and i will keep working on it, for more long
term goals
