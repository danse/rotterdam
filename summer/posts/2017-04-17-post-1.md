title: lost in code tasks
---

A feature of code is that it unifies knowledge. Through its language,
through it symbols, it brings us to fit knowledge into a common
structure.

I now have a lot of "meta" issues on Github, issues which could lead
to the creation of a repo. Prioritising them is becoming
challenging. My intuition needs to be driven by an overview of the
possibilities and the constraints.

Also, i have online issues and offline issues, and i don't have a
system to publish or download them in bulk.

I could write some code, some software, to help me out. But i need it
to start from level zero of sophistication, i want the system to be in
place before the software, so that i can develop the software in a way
that is sustainable for me given my small availability of time.

Medusa is already my barebones system for managing tasks, even though
its functionalities are extremely limited at the moment. I can turn my
`meta` repo into a directory with Medusa files for now, which will
allow offline operativeness and online sharing. From there i can keep
developing on Medusa.

The other similar tool i find online is
[`th`](https://github.com/damianfral/th), but it doesn't seem actively
maintained. I got in touch with its author
