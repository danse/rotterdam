title: programmers should be good communicators
---


I was way a worse programmer when i was a worse communicator, because
a lot of coding is about communicating.

I realised this today reading a pull request. I never enjoyed
reviewing pull requests, i just had to do it because it was effective
and fruitful in a number of ways.

In the last months, living as a nomad made me a better communicator,
and now i'm seeing the impact on my profession. This impact is more
subtle that i had imagined.

So today, when reviewing a pull request, suddently i was struck by a
different perspective on code. I always considered code to be
something between me, or its author, and the machine. Suddently i saw
the code as a way for the team to communicate internally, and that
made me perform my review in a totally different way, which felt way
more natural and effective.

We are told that programmers are bad communicators, mad scientists
which are allowed to behave sometimes in rather inhuman ways. Our
culture justifies that, so that we don't see much dissonance.

Almost ten years ago while studying mechanical engineering i started
learning about the importance of communication in science, math and
engineering, but it sounds like i still have a lot to learn
