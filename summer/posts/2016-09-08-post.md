This week is short in terms of worked hours but full of inspiration
and insights, for example:

- realising what was a keystone object in my habits at home
- realising how much effort it takes me to keep working with tools i
  consider inadequate
- thinking about unconventional way to redefine my relationship with
  Berlin, in a way that is not just stay or leave
- adding cool new features to my job selection script

Anyway, none of these led to writing yet, but today i have got
inspired about something which is worth at least a quick note, before
running out to the gorgeous evening Berlin is offering today.

I was casually chatting with someone in the Co Up lounge when i
realised that the people around me had the same concerns about work i
had. Before leaving the place, i've read a copy of "A cartoonist's
advice" from Bill Watterson hanging from a wall in the lounge. I
realised that i am not the only person who is trying to live Berlin in
a different way, and that i am surrounded by others probably more
brave, visionary and ambitious than me.

This hint brings its contribution to my daily oscillation between two
Lorenz attractors, and leaves me even more undecided about the
future. Still, this is how i am living this week: every insight seems
to be disruptive of something, but every time i seem to feel better,
and stronger. This time, i feel less alone. Thanks Co Up.
