title: entering barcelona through a different door
----

some theory turned into experience, and a lot of experience doesn't
have a theory any longer

laming hard, in order to keep my faster beats aligned with the slower

in order to keep the jumps of my ego too small to reach the fetish

and i can make it, i can carry the mountains with me, and the fire of
my passion, under control

and i'm out of control

gliding close to the ground, ready to land

in a difficult exercise of integration

how to integrate the big with the small, the fast with the slow, the
many with the few, the strong with the weak, the rich with the poor

freedom and respect, creativity and awareness?

just received a message from my love. how to? together
