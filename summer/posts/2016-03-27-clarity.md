Spent the whole day with my family, my creative brother here, so today
i was motivated to abandon the usual techy topics and do something
small for my site.

Now i can actually use clear fonts, so that even the post title will
look clearer in the list. This is a prerequisite for writing something
interesting for others to read, otherwise they would get lost among my
personal notes.

Marsala wine is flowing here, and we are tired from the long day, but
luckily i am using Haskell so code still works and gets better even
though the brain is ready for surrender
