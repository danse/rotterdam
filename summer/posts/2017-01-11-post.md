title: Seasons of Berlin
----

Today i went to Nano while snow was abundantly falling, it was
beautiful. I looked out of the window while drinking my coffee, and i
could perfectly remember how that looked in the middle of Summer.

I am really enjoying this unexpected period in Berlin, in a limbo
between excitement due to my new freedom and the incertainties related
to my new lifestyle. I am living the present during maybe one of my
last opportunities to feel part of this city and its communities.

I am aware of some long-running investments that did not pay off. I
bought myself more time, and i keep giving myself room and refusing to
panic, but the direction to pursue is not clear, nor the methodology
to follow. This might not be negative though, it might be the result
of a learning process, i feel like i have too much data, and i need
time to process it.

I also need time to collect personal resources, too. I just calculated
that the relocation made me consume most of my vacation time. I am
working with very limited resources, and my goal is ambitious,
therefore i need to be patient. I am enjoying the change of season
though. It's Winter, time to focus again on frames, plans,
programs. Time to be rational, time to make things work better
