title: fading summer
---

After Mangrove Education i have a couple of clues about social media i
want to use. One idea is to write more often, in order to become more
fluent in sharing. The other idea is to document your process, since
that is good material to share with others. Starting from these
premises i want to share my current professional status and ideas
about the future, in a very honest and open way.

I am coming back to my activity now that a distracting Summer is
starting to fade out. I would like to keep the Summer mood on still
for a while, but my numbers tell me that the party is over, for this
year. I realise that it has been almost one year since when i started
moving to actual freelancing and to remote work, and it is probably a
good moment to draw a balance.

In comparison with the year before, i am way less bold and
confident. Remote work gave me hard times, Sicily gave me hard times,
Haskell gave me hard times, German taxes gave me hard times. Yes, this
hasn't been a glorious year, but rather an year of hard times and
struggles, when i have been consuming my resources rather than
replenishing them. Before starting, i considered this an investment to
be done, but after one year what is the return on this investment? A
tiny bit of money from Upwork, and hopefully a lot of personal
growth. There isn't much else that i can count, quantify, or use even
for peer or social recognition. One thing is clear though: after one
year, i find myself in a way lower energetic state, to borrow an image
from systems theory.
