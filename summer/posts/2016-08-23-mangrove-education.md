title: Mangrove Education
---

I have been learning a lot in the past days during the [Mangrove
Education](http://edu.meetmangrove.com/) event. These have been busy
days and i definitely won't have the time to turn my experiences in a
consistent post. One of the key insights i got from Olivier, though,
is the importance of having a commitment in publishing. I think that i
need that, at least for a while, in order to become better at sharing
my work and the results of my personal research. I might try to
publish at least once a week. This week, my post will just consist in
a few notes about what i learned.

I have been learning a lot, but i felt the need to take some notes
just starting from the morning of the education day, while Svenia was
talking about the outcomes of her world education tour.

## Notes

### Education day

##### Future of education by Svenia

- the flipped classroom introduces scale in content production
- artificial intelligence brings scale to basic English teaching in
  India (Vahan)
- Manaiakanali with their three step system featured the most
  enthousiast students

##### Artificial Intelligence by Yannis

- compounding effect, for example applying reinforcement learning to a
  neural network, brings effects which are more than linear
- survival bias

##### Incertainty and Chaos by Mathieu

- intercultural literacy

one of the main skills needed for _intercultural communication_ is to be
able to tolerate an high level of incertainty

- "throw it at the wall and see what sticks"

### Data day

#### Aimilia

- pair analysis: scatterplots between every two dimensions, two lines in R

#### Yannis

- convolutional neural networks
- experience replay: a mind repeats relevant experiences more times

#### Thomas, Lean Analytics

find your business model, then find your stage

empathy, stickiness, virality, revenue, scale

find the one metric which matters for your model and your stage, there
is a table providing inspiration

find your line in the sand

##### What about me

- business: consultancy
- stage: empathy
- metric: number of clients in parallel
- line: 3

### Video editing by Max

Knowing the editing before filming helps a lot. For example having the
music in mind Max did long and short shots, collecting the elements
which match the music.

Close ups. Focus on the guitar to focus on the guitar solo music.

Show different angles.

Keep directions.

Aggressive cuts. Remove esitation in talks. Somebody throwing the
pillow, somebody catching the pillow, no trajectory.

Rhythm to support storytelling. The beat is the cut ... long shots,
short shots, can be synchronised with the music, for example a cut
every four music beat, then every two beats, crescendo.

Audio synchro

Be wild

### Organisation day

[Tasa](http://tasa-sovellus.b-part.eu/index-en.html)
Appgree

#### Organisation Innovation by Mathieu

Google's [project
Aristoteles](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html). Norms
turned out to be the most important aspect of high achiever teams.

High achievers featured:
- People talk the same amount of time in meetings
- People were sensitive to others' feelings
- Psycological safety: people can show their weaknesses. A team
  climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in
  which people are comfortable being themselves

[Reinventing organisations](https://vimeo.com/121517508). The main
challenge of teal organisations is recruiting.

#### Tristan Harris

- Ethics is about things we don't see
- Doubt club
- Mission Statement -> Mission Question

### Growth day

#### by Louis

Amplitude, Mix Panel, Keen.io

#### How to find the audience for our projects by Adrien

##### Twitter mass follow

We want to keep a balance between followed and not followed, so after
some time people who do not follow back should be unfollowed. There is
a simple extension but there are also better tools. Ideally we want to
blacklist people that we already followed and unfollowed, in order not
to spam then.

##### From followers to the landing page

New followers can be welcomed with a direct message. Pinned
tweets. Then obviously the short description

## Wrapping up

It's a quiet afternoon in the cosy innovation space at Betahaus. Many
participants already left to catch their flight. Slight noises come
from the few of us who still stay, every one of us in their frame,
their device. The infinite possibility on the Internet are still on
the other side of the screen, but i still feel that i cannot take
distance easily from the experiences, the warmth and the sense of
community and belonging.

I turn my time tracker off. I had not done that before this
experience. How deeply did this experience change me? How much will i
keep with me? And how much was i able to share?

Well before living this, i thought that i could hardly share some of
my deepest thoughts and values with a community, but here maybe it
happened. The openness and creativity, and the possibility to mix work
on the body, work on the self, work on the product and work on
society, this is also something i thought was impossible. I can still
feel some dissonance, but i also feel like i just got a train to come
closer to my destination, while before i was going by foot.

The creators of Mangrove are right. Loneliness is tough to deal with,
and they found a way to attack loneliness, at least for some persons,
at least for a while. I am looking forward to further developments
