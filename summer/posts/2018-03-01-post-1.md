title: ibla or catania
----

ibla feels like the final destination of my tour, the upcoming month a
short tail from which to start over again in the opposite direction

in some sense it doesn't matter whether it's a tail with poison or
not, it's the tail and i'm directed there, to the bottom and back up,
or to the top and back down

if i will go to catania i could never experience ibla again, if i will
go to ibla it could take even more energy away from me and push me
even further on this path towards a deep personal change. i'm not
looking forward to change more, i'm just on this path and i've been
offered a last mile

in ibla are some migrants, the abandoned houses and the empty tourism,
the lost soul of this city, some friends, the nature, more loneliness,
more time to spend with my soul

in catania is the people and our blind energy, dirt, the streams that
disperse with generosity, but most of all a rising path again, some
action i'm craving, allies and a way out

i think it's going to be catania, because i want to start gently
losing myself again, mix my waters to the winds and the seas. i had
enough connection and reconciliation, now movement leads me to another
direction

this is a good way to leave, balancing the goal with a warm
attachment. this transforms the dirt before i even move, and enables
me to look at it for what it is

finally i don't care much, my fire slowly burns within
