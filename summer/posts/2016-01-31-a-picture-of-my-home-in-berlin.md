After two months in Italy and Sicily, as i arrived back to my small
flat in Berlin i had a surprising feeling of familiarity and
relaxation, as if the disposition of objects told a story that i was
happy to listen.

While unpacking, i felt the need to make a video of the interiors, as
i did in the past right before abandoning my preceeding homes. I don't
want to forget the nice small things that i gathered here, the simple
lifestyle.

This was the first flat where i lived completely on my own and not
conditioned by anybody. I see it as a bubble of loneliness and
freedom, an experiment whose results are important to me, as i don't
know whether this will happen again in the future.

For a while, my life here seemed steady and consistent, and i was
satisfied about it, but i was planning to strengthen my connection
with my origins. I travelled and checked the possibilities, saying
around that i was looking for a way back, but postponing decisions to
when i would be back in Berlin. Now i can decide to stay here longer,
it is comfortable, convenient and way easier now, and i like it.

Anyway, after my last trip, i feel different. I can see Berlin from
the eyes of a nomad, and i might start weighing some anchors
soon. Hence the need to take a snapshot, with a camera, or with these
words.

I might write here what i consider precious and remarkable, but i
prefer to live it through the upcoming days. I will leave time for
thoughts and emotions to settle, in order to move with confidence.
