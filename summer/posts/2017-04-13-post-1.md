title: trading in dreams
---

sometimes you pay the price for a job in advance, the day of your
interview, and in an unexpected way.

you pay it in dreams. You come there with your bag of dreams, and you
offer it to them. Will they buy it?

i don't want to be negative, not all jobs are the same. Sometimes your
dreams will be payed back to you, with all the interests.

some other times, your dreams are the only fuel that keeps the wrecked
machine on the road. They will drip inside the gears, messily. They
will do their flow, they won't be back.

it can be worth the compromise. You can get other things in
exchange. What's important is to be aware, and maybe ready to react if
your life is going in a direction you don't want it to go
