title: tonight
---

It's the first time that nomading i decide to work from home. Until
now i always organised myself in order to reach a coworking, but here
for one week it was not worth it. Working from home gives me a fuzzy
feeling and reminds me a lot of university. The day went differently
than my usual working days, but it's the night that impressed me and
led me to write a new post.

It's like when i was doing late nights, as a teenager, on the first
web. It's like many nights in Berlin. It's my night, my computer, the
shiny lights, the Internet, and the darkness around. I feel more
paranoid, and at the same time more comfortable and aware, in my dark
corner, watching the world through armless, flat pixels.

And it's like many nights at University, and really many nights of my
life. Before the Internet, games. Windows beyond reality.
