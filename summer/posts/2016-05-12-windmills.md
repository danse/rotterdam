I just arrived back to my small flat in Berlin. Being in the city
excites me and the flat is cosy and familiar, even though there are a
few ugly corners and signs of negligence.

This morning i was having breakfast in Syracuse. I liked it
there. Berlin of course is a different thing. Thriving. But i wish i
had more time to stay in Syracuse. I will visit it again, but could i
be happy there?

My new remote client is not complaining despite the frequent
interruptions i am doing for the traveling, and this feels like a
miracle to me. But i could also take it as an hint that my ideas were
not totally wrong. Still i am looking forward to a bit of quiet and
normality, also to reflect on this.

I took this evening for myself. From tomorrow, things will start
moving again. This small flat, and my Berliner routine, are going to
be disrupted more than they already were so far. I will destroy my
shelter, and by doing so i will take a stand about what i consider
important.

Giants? Or windmills?
