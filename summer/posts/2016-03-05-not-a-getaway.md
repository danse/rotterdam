I spent a lot of energies to have it really clear, that this is not a
getaway, that i am giving something valuable away in order to come
back to Sicily and do something good for my country of origin.

Yet, this sounds so crazy even to myself, that despite evidence i need
to keep stating it again and again.

I wouldn't like to lose all the good experiences, relationships,
opportunities, and the many other resources this city offers me. But
what would the future of southern Italy be, if everybody opted to move
to a different place, were living is easier? My relatives, my region
and my country invested in me to make me grow healthy, knowledgeable
and skilled. Should i just ignore their altruism, and go spend the
result of this investment elsewhere?

No, i won't.

I will try, try at least, to give back.


Still, i still have a bit of time before saying goodbye to Berlin. I
still have some time to keep repeating myself that it would be
convenient, and sensible, to stay here. I will keep repeating myself
that as funny as it sounds, in this world ruled by money and profit i
am trying to be generous and fair
