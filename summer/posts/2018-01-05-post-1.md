title: giorgio, claudia and our way out
----

i just said goodbye to some friends i see rarely, who came back from a
long on-the-road trip to australia.

when talking about social media, internet culture and staying in
touch, we realised that blogs are still probably the best way to
publish and share. this is how giorgio and claudia shared their travel
experiences with their friends.

this clicks with a lot of my current beliefs. i'll try it in practice
without theorizing it too much. i think that's going to me my way out,
hopefully our way out. i'll start from listening, which means
reading. haven't read blogs in a while.
