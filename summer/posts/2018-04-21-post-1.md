title: over control
----

taking off looking at the ground, at the horizon, at the sky
making room in a sequence of small steps towards the same direction
Ã¨ un modo di offrire a tutti il superamento dello strumento

use to the tool
us over control
if our mind knows what it wants
we can work lifting
keeping our electronic memory
to the lower priority
