working with language with the voice is more comfortable then by writing
where comfort = efficiency + enjoyment
until the point where writing it down gets more comfortable

sometimes i just need to stend up and walk a bit around the room

less desk, more respect

years of virtual technological work created in me the association
between operating on my devices and working

except i realised that i get the most impactful ideas, also as a
programmer, when not being operating my devices

would you stand in an office and stare at the window, silent,
listening to the music in your hears?

it feels to comfortable to a work environment, right?

why don't we consider our thought process worth being considered as
work, unless we are operating a device?

maybe our job ethics come from a time when distractions weren't coming
from tools

deep usage of a tool learned when stepping away from it
